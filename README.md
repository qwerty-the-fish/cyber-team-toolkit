# A Collaborative Toolkit and Guide to CTFs

This project aims to create a community-driven hub for cyber security enthusiasts at any level.

Whether you're at the start of your cyber journey, have played a few CTFs and are still building your skills, or are an experienced professional in the field - hopefully, you'll find something new here!

Inspired by GCHQ's open-source project CyberChef, the goal is to create a repository full of tips, advice, tools, links, and so much more. Pooling together the incredible knowledge base and skill-set of everyone in the cyber security field.

Chances are there's just the tool you're looking for out there, but without the right pointer from a teammate or stumbling across the perfect writeup, you may never come across it. This project hopes to solve this problem.

## Pages
- [Writeups](https://github.com/qwerty-the-fish/cyber-team-toolkit/blob/main/writeups.md)
- [Trainings and Certifications](https://github.com/qwerty-the-fish/cyber-team-toolkit/blob/main/trainings_and_certifications.md)
- [Tools](https://github.com/qwerty-the-fish/cyber-team-toolkit/tree/main/tools)
- [Guides](https://github.com/qwerty-the-fish/cyber-team-toolkit/tree/main/guides)

## The Goal

As you can tell, there isn't much content here at the moment. The goal is to change that though!

I would love for this to become a source of useful information, including:

- links and quick guides to tools/software
- links to writeups you've found especially useful
- tips and tricks for specific types of CTF questions (and CTFs in general)!
- links to any training resources you found interesting
- links to certifications worth giving a go
- links to any related communities that people might want to join to meet others in the field
- and much, much more...

It's ambitious I know, and whilst I hope to update it with my own tips and tricks over time, any contributions (no matter how small) would be deeply appreciated. 

## I'd like to join as an 'admin'

As much as I'd love to keep the repository as open as possible - I think we all know the potential for unwanted spam... Unfortunately, this means I have to set up a PR process where changes need approval before they can be merged. Fancy helping out with approving any PRs? Or even helping to grow this project? Let me know!

## I would like to contribute

Amazing! Everything helps - whether it's a link to a useful writeup you came across, a tip for a tool already mentioned, or perhaps an entirely new tool not listed here.
