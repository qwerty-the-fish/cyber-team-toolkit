## Sock Puppets

!!! definition "Define: Sock puppets"
    Online fictitious identifies used to conceal the true identity of the OSINT investigator.

    [SANS - What are Sock Puppets in OSINT](https://www.sans.org/blog/what-are-sock-puppets-in-osint/)

**Pros of using sock puppets**:

- provides access to data sources that might otherwise be inaccessible
- provides anonymity to the investigator
- enables real-time monitoring as they enable you to observe real-time developments
- can be used to monitor specific individuals/groups without drawing attention

**Cons of using sock puppets**:

- detection algorithms are improving and sockpuppet accounts may be flagged either by the platform itself or by other users who notice inconsistencies in their behaviour
- maintaining several sock puppets can be time-consuming and resource-intensive - all accounts must exhibit normal behaviour as any unusual patterns may reveal them to be fake
