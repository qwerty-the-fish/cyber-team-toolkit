# Guides

Sometimes the biggest hurdle when it comes to CTFs is knowing where to start with a question.

Everyone has their own approaches to tackling problems, but sometimes having a rough idea of where to start can make all the difference.

The guides can be as general as "how do CTFs work?" to more specific topics such as "answering CTF questions involving DTMF tones".

Even tips that seem really obvious to you now might be an invaluable piece of advice to a beginner.

!!! note "Some questions to inspire you"
    - what tools would you use first?
    - if the question provides you with a file, do you need to process it in a specific way first?
    - have you ever encountered this kind of question in a more challenging form, how did you go about solving it?
    - what do you during the first ten minutes of a CTF competition?
    - is there a really niche topic you saw appear in a CTF once, what did you learn about it?
