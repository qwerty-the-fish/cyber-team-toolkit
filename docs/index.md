Inspired by GCHQ's open-source project CyberChef, the goal of this project is to create a repository full of tips, advice, tools, links to favourite resources, and so much more.

It's the contributions and knowledge of many that will help this to become a valuable resource - benefiting those at the start of their cyber careers, building their existing CTF skills, or even seasoned professionals looking for new tooling inspiration. So please don't hesitate to contribute!
