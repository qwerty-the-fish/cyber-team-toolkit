# Tool Recommendations

- **Got a tool to recommend?**
    - Add any relevant links and a short summary to the appropriate category in `all_tools.md`.
    - Links to any examples of how to use the tool are particularly helpful.

- **Got more to say about it?**
    - Create a new `.md` file in this directory with any additional information you wish to add.
    - This might include: breakdown of useful commands, screenshots showing how to use it, installation tips, etc.
    - Link back to it under your entry in `all_tools.md`.
