# Tools

Got a tool you couldn't live without in a CTF? Share it here!

Make sure to add it to `all.md` under the appropriate category - any relevant links and a short summary is perfect.

If you want to provide additional information (have you got some great tips for how to use the tool for different tasks?) - why not create a new file here and link it back to your entry in `all.md`?

This would be extremely valuable as sometimes the official documentation can be a little confusing (especially for a beginner!) and seeing an example of how to use the tool can be invaluable.
