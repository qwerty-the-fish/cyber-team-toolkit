# Guides

The aim of this section is to provide quick guides for the varying types of questions you may encounter during a CTF. Any tips and tricks you might have are perfect here!

One of the biggest hurdles with CTF questions can often be just knowing where to begin, so think about what the first steps are that you take when you encounter each kind of question.
- Is there a specific tool you use first?
- Do you need to process the file in some way before running any analysis tools? (e.g. does it need unzipping first)
- Have you ever encountered this kind of question in a more challenging form (e.g. information usually provided wasn't given to you this time) - how did you go about approaching it?

Feel free to add to any existing guide - or create your own! It doesn't have to be a general topic either, it could be something as specific as dealing with `DTMF tones`! You never know when some really specific advice might come in useful...
